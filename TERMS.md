- The bot is provided as-is for personal household use (task management, grocery lists, calendar, general chat).

## Limitations

- The bot relies on third-party services (Anthropic, Twilio, Google) and may be unavailable if those services experience outages.
- Responses are AI-generated and may not always be accurate.

## Liability

This is a personal hobby project. No warranties are provided, and no liability is assumed for any actions taken based on the bot's responses.

# Privacy Policy

**Bowdy Bot** is a private family assistant operated by Gib Bowden for personal household use only.

## Data Collection

- **SMS messages**: Incoming messages are processed by the bot and stored locally in a SQLite database to maintain conversation context.
- **Phone numbers**: Only pre-approved (allowlisted) phone numbers can interact with the bot. No other numbers are stored or processed.
- **Calendar data**: The bot accesses a shared family Google Calendar to view, create, and delete events on behalf of family members.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored on a private server. No data is shared with third parties beyond the services required to operate the bot (Anthropic for AI processing, Twilio for SMS delivery, Google for calendar access).
- Message history may be retained for conversation continuity and is not used for any other purpose.

## Data Sharing

- No personal data is sold, shared, or used for marketing purposes.
- Data is only transmitted to service providers (Anthropic, Twilio, Google) as necessary to deliver bot functionality.
